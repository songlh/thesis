\label{chap:ldoctor}

Statistical performance debugging discussed in the last chapter can 
identify which loop is the root cause for a performance problem. 
However, it cannot provide detailed root-cause information, 
such as why a loop is inefficient and how developers might fix the problem. 

In this chapter, we first conduct an empirical study to understand what are
fine-grained root-cause information for inefficient loops in the real world. 
We then design a series of static-dynamic hybrid analysis routines that can
help identify accurate fine-grained root-cause information for inefficient loops.
We further use sampling techniques to lower our diagnosis overhead without
hurting diagnosis accuracy or latency. Evaluation using real-world inefficient loops 
shows that our tool can provide good coverage and accuracy, 
with small runtime overhead.
