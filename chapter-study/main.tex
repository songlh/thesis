\label{chap:study}

Empirical studies on functional bugs have successfully guided the design of functional software testing, 
bug detection, and failure diagnosis. 
Poor understanding of performance bugs is part of the causes of today's performance-bug problems. 
The lack of empirical studies on performance bugs has severely 
limited the design of performance-bug avoidance, testing, detection, and fixing tools.

This chapter presents our comprehensive study of real-world performance bugs, 
based on 110 bugs randomly collected from the bug databases of five representative 
open-source software suites (Apache, Chrome, GCC, Mozilla, and MySQL). 
Following the lifetime of performance bugs, our empirical study is performed in 4 dimensions: 
the root-cause of performance bugs, how performance bugs are introduced, 
how to expose performance bugs and how to fix performance bugs. Our findings and implications can guide future research in this area, 
and have already inspired our own performance-bug detection and performance failure diagnosis work.
