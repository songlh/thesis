Performance bugs are software implementation mistakes, which can cause inefficient execution. 
Performance bugs are common and severe, and they have already become one major source of software's performance problem. 
With the increasing complexity
of modern software and workload, the meager increases of single-core hardware performance, and the pressing energy concerns, 
it is urgent to combat performance bugs. 

This dissertation targets to improve the state-of-the-art performance bug fighting techniques. 
We start from an empirical study on real-world performance bugs in order to get a better understanding of performance bugs in Chapter~\ref{chap:study}.
Inspired by our empirical study, 
we build a series of rule-based static checkers to identify previously unknown performance bugs in Chapter~\ref{chap:detec}. 
We explore how to apply statistical debugging to diagnose user-perceived performance bugs in Chapter~\ref{chap:sd}. 
Statistical debugging cannot answer all the questions, 
so we design a series of static-dynamic hybrid analysis for inefficient 
loops to provide fine-grained diagnosis information in Chapter~\ref{chap:ldoctor}. 

In this chapter, we first summarize our study work and built techniques in Section~\ref{sec:7_summary}. 
We then list a set of lessons learned over the course of our work in Section~\ref{sec:7_lessons}. 
Finally we discuss directions for future research in Section~\ref{sec:7_future}.
